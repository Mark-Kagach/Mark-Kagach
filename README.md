## Hi, I'm Mark! I work on AI safety research. Here's my repo guide:

1. **[learning_techical_ai_safety](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_techical_ai_safety)**: Started on Sep 2025, this is my main repo. Here I upload my practices for improving my technical and theoretical skills in AI safety research. Technically I either work through some coding textbook (HOMLP, AIMA...), do practice projects, or re-implement papers. Theoretically I try to thoroughly explain entire fields (say ML, DL, AI Safety), or specific papers, from fully blank document.
2. **[learning_full_stack_web_dev](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_full_stack_web_dev)**:
3. **[quantifying-the-value-of-delayed-ovarian-aging](https://github.com/EliasSchlie/quantifying-the-value-of-delayed-ovarian-aging)**:
4. yearly_work_hours: For several years I have been tracking my weekly work hours, it is usually between 50-60 hours, with outliers being 40 or 70. (These are real sitting-on-my-ass-and-working hours, not "hanging out, chilling, eating work hours".)
