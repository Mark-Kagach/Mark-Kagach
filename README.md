## Hi, I'm Mark!

I work on AI safety research. Here's the guide to my repos:

- [learning_techical_ai_safety](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_techical_ai_safety):
- [learning_full_stack_web_dev](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_full_stack_web_dev):
- [quantifying-the-value-of-delayed-ovarian-aging](https://github.com/EliasSchlie/quantifying-the-value-of-delayed-ovarian-aging)

And here's my general intro message from my website (markkagach.com):

> I want to understand reality and greatly progress humanity, all while building trustworthy decades-long relationships and having fun. 

That led me to work on AI safety research.

Currently I'm focused on becoming unignorably good by doing consistent deliberate practice (repo) and accomplishing progressively ambitious projects. (Also trying to move to Silicon Valley via O1, help highly appreciated!)

Previously I was searching for a well-fitting problem and craft to maximize my impact. Exploring fields like longevity, epistemology, metascience, web-dev, and startups. Usually I'd make a guess, intensely dive into it, and try making something worthy of remark, e.g.:

I made two handbooks (≈200p. each) and several podcasts simply explaining David Deutsch books, both were endorsed by David. 

I spent about half a year each, first trying to become a web developer, and then longevity researcher. Both were documented here and here respectively.

I worked at Onramper as a BD and helped them launch a subscription model; left after MoonPay’s acquisition.

For more read essays from My Evolving Almanack on my life’s: philosophy, goals, principles, or where I come from. You can also explore the projects below.

I made this website to connect with aligned people and build a seamless web of deserved trust. Consider coming along :)
