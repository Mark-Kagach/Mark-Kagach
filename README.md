## Hi, I'm Mark! I work on technical AI safety. Here's my repo guide:

1. **[techical_ai_safety_mastery](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_techical_ai_safety)**: **Repo dedicated to consistently and deliberately practicing to improve my technical and theoretical skills in technical AI safety.** Started on Sep 2025. Technically I either work through some coding textbook (HOMLP, AIMA...), do practice projects, or re-implement papers. Theoretically I try to thoroughly explain entire fields (say ML, DL, AI Safety), or specific papers, from a fully blank document.

      1a. **[quantifying-the-value-of-delayed-ovarian-aging](https://github.com/EliasSchlie/quantifying-the-value-of-delayed-ovarian-aging)**: As part of practice project in Nov 2025 won AAAA Hackathon (2,500$) with my friend Elias Schlie. We created an agent that scraped 1000s of papers. And after processing data we presented results via [beautiful website](https://menopauselater.framer.website) for public outreach.

3. **[learning_cs_and_web_dev](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_full_stack_web_dev)**: Inspired by [Scott Young finishing](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/) MIT CS bachelor in one year, I pursued a similar CS self-study with full stack web-dev focus for 8 months (from Jun 2024 to Feb 2025). Got proficient in JS, but pivoted to ML and technical AI safety.

4. **[yearly_work_hours](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/yearly_work_hours)**: For several years I have been tracking my weekly work hours, it is usually between 50-60, with outliers of 40 or 70. (These are real sitting-on-my-ass-and-working hours, not "hanging out in library hours"! ♥)
